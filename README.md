## Using the Instagram Memento Scraper
The Python script takes the URI-M as a command line argument. For example, if you want to scrape information from https://web.archive.org/web/20170214033011/https://www.instagram.com/beyonce/, then you would navigate to the folder that contains the Python script and run the script with the following piece of code:

```ps
python instagram_memento_scraper.py --urim https://web.archive.org/web/20170214033011/https://www.instagram.com/beyonce/
```
